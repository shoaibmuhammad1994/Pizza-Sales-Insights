## Diving into Data Insights Using SQL 📊
At the foundation of this endeavor lies a comprehensive analysis powered by SQL queries. With a fine-tooth comb, I've combed through the raw data, unearthing hidden gems of insight. This meticulous SQL analysis helped solidify the bedrock of our key performance indicators (KPIs) and laid the groundwork for the subsequent visual journey.
## 🍕📊 An Interactive Power BI Dashboard 📈🍕 
Armed with insights extracted from the data with SQL queries, I seamlessly transitioned to crafting an interactive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard serves as a dynamic canvas, portraying the trends and nuances uncovered through SQL analysis. By marrying SQL findings with Power BI's visual prowess, I've ensured the accuracy and reliability of our KPIs. The dashboard not only illuminates KPIs but also reveals the very pulse of the pizza business, breathing life into revenue patterns, customer behavior, order dynamics, and more. 
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 📊
- **Total Revenue**: Total revenue generated by the company -  This metric offer insights that inform strategic decisions and drive future growth.
- **Average Order Value**: Average amount spent per order – This metric unveils spending patterns, guiding business understanding of how customers engage with the business offerings.
- **Total Pizzas Sold**: Total number/quantity of pizza’s sold over a specific period of time - This metric serves as a compass, guiding business owner through the growth trajectory. This count stands as a testament to the business's expanding influence.
- **Total Orders**: Monitor order influx to optimize operations within the chosen timeframe - This metric helps in illuminating the path toward streamlined efficiency and enhanced customer satisfaction.
- **Average Pizza per Order**: To find out how many pizzas, on average, are ordered per transaction - This metric unveils a treasure trove of insights, offering a deep understanding of customer preferences and consumption patterns. 
**Daily & Monthly Trends** 📅
This dashboard masterfully fuses visualization and data analysis, unveiling rhythms in total orders. SQL-driven insights transform these trends into a symphony of agile sales strategies, navigating the currents of customer preferences.
**Pizza Category & Size** 🍕
Beyond visuals, the dashboard's oracle-like essence reveals sales proportions, drawing from SQL's panoramic view of customer inclinations. This culinary canvas marries Power BI's allure with SQL's precision, empowering strategic choices.
**Top 5 & Bottom 5 Pizzas** 🏆
Empowerment emanates through SQL-infused insights spotlighting the culinary cosmos – top and bottom pizzas. Beyond surface, this compass guides enhancements, rekindling allure and spotlighting success. SQL's foundation refines strategy, steering stakeholders with flair.
## SQL & Power BI Functionalities used 💡
Throughout the project, I made the most of various SQL and Power BI features.
### SQL [Queries](https://github.com/shoaibmuhammad1994/Pizza-Sales-Insights/blob/main/SQL%20Queries%20used.docx)
- **SUM**: I have used the SUM function in calculating KPI’s like Total Revenue, Total Quantity Sold and in many more metrics.
- **COUNT & DISTINCT**: Some orders have more than one pizza’s. To find the exact number of orders I used the Count function along with the Distinct function.
- **CAST & DECIMAL**: To get a readable number I have used the CAST & Decimal functions to get remove the extra digits after the decimal points.
- **DATETIME**: DATETIME was really helpful in finding daily, and monthly trends. 
## Power BI [Dashboard](https://github.com/shoaibmuhammad1994/Pizza-Sales-Insights/blob/main/Pizza%20Sales%20Dashboard.pbix)
- **DAX Functions**: Utilizing powerful DAX functions to calculate and analyze data effectively.
- **Calculated Columns**: Derived columns form the existing data to gain accurate insights like Day Name, Month Name.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Made use of the conditional formatting to highlight important metrics and trends..
- **Filtering**: Implementing filters to allow users to explore data based on their preferences.
